      "message": "I figured that the reset-gpio-val file should just be created or updated by default. The first time it runs through the code, it won\u0027t do a bios reset cause the file won\u0027t exist, which makes sense cause you wouldn\u0027t need a bios reset on first boot.\n\nIf the busctl call fails, the user might call it again by doing a busctl call themselves, which wouldn\u0027t update reset-gpio-val, so it might trigger an extra bios reset on reboot. So I think reset-gpio-val should stay up to date regardless of whether the busctl call here succeeds.",
